On Thursday, July 10, the Contributor Catalyst program took a trip to San Fransico and thenm to Oakland for dinner.
Some of the detail of thr trip was the ride upt o San Fransico. I took lots of pickture that I would look back at o the comming year.
A another deatil of the trip os going to GitHub and getting a tour from onm of the workers name Pj Metz. There was ALOT of stair that was climb in the tour,
but it was fun. Escpecially finding srecret room within the office and all of the cool little detail that I was while there at GitHub.
After the tour, we then got a speech that Pj also gave us about confusion and why it is a good thing to be confused. 
Then once we was done at GitHub, we would then go to the Golden agte bridge where we was able to roam the area and there was a museam that I found interesting.
After that we would then go to Oakland to try out a resturant called Brenda's. They had very good food. And the service waa great too.
AFter dinner we all then went home, and that was my day in San Fransico and Oakland.
