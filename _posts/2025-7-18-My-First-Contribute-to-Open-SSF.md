On Friday, July 18, my team and I would start to make our first contribute to the Open SSF scorecard 
repository project. The first thing that we did was go over some of the isssue that we founf in the 
last couple of days. Once we decided on the the issure that we did we went through the steps of changing
it. I believe that the next issue tha we should work on is another dicumentation issue. I feel it would give
us more practice with understanding how to make commits to the Open SSF community.
