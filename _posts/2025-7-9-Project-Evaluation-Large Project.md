1. The purpose of p5.js is its a web application that allows the user to type code,and with the code it would turn it into art. 


2. Based on my findings, there are 121 people working on this project.


3. The project is a very active project, there were 60 commits in the last 30 days and 777 in the last year.


4. The first place that you would go is their website  to find how to contribute to the project.


5. On the p5js website, they have an introduction section on their website, where they have tutorials on how to set up your environment, variables and changes, conditional and interactivity, repeating and loops, data structure garden, and animating with media objects. They also have other documentation on the website like web design, accessibility, webGL, etc.


6. The bigs are featured with the issues on the github and they have a pull request tab on github. In the github there are  319 issues that are open. There are also 72 pull requests that are also unanswered. Issues are being addressed, there are 3,579 pull requests that are closed and there are 3,817 closed issues. 


7. I believe that if you were to download this content to your laptop, it shouldn't take too long for it to download.


8. Ways that the  developers talk to each other is through the slack channels that they have for the project. That's one way, another way is through the social media they have for the project.


9. The most intriguing discovery from looking at this open source project is seeing how the project is structured and the multiple sites that they have connected to the project. Another discovery is to see all of the changes that were made while the project has been active. With having a big project community like p5.js, tons of pull requests and issues have been answered and written in their github, SO seeing how the project has evolved over time is interesting to see and see the growth that the project has.


10. The way that a big project compares to the smaller project is that the bigger project is more structured than the smaller project, there are more people that contribute to the bigger project than the smaller project. But I feel that there is more of a connection with people in the smaller project than the bigger one. In my opinion, I would contribute to blogger projects more than the smaller ones.
