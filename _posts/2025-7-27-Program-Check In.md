Since joining this program earlier this summer, I felt that I have taken  steps in reaching my goal of helping with ALS treatment. Maybe it is not the straightest  path to that goal but I feel any step that I take to getting there is positive. 

Something that can be done between now and the end of the program is improve on many different techniques when it comes to open source. Continue to improve in the skills that I want to strengthen during this program.

I feel that the job that  Emily, Silas, and Samir is doing is great and there are no changes that need to be made.
