Abby Kearns’ talk on open source really resonated with me as a Gen Zer stepping into the tech world. Her focus on transparency, collaboration, and community driven innovation lines up with a lot of the values my generation shares. For me, it’s been a place where I learn best by doing whether that’s contributing to documentation or digging into a codebase to solve a real problem. When Abby described open source as an important resource for building trust and making progress in AI, it stood out to me. Authenticity and access matter a lot to us.
One thing I think is missing from the conversation is how Gen Z tends to approach open source differently. A lot of us start off as quiet learners. We’re also drawn to projects that connect with our values. If open source communities want more Gen Z contributors, they could make it easier to start small with micro contributions, provide mentorship through platforms we actually use , and show the real world impact of our work. Adding some engagement and visible progress could also help keep us engaged.
