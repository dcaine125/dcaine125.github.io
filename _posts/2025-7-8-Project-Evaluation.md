1. The purpose of the project OpenSSF is t o check the security of certain open source projects to see how safe they are.

2. Based on my findings, there are 116 people working on this project.

3. The project is semi-active. The last update was last week, but before that it was about a month ago. 

4. The first place that you will start is by looking at their website that is listed on the side of their repository. Once you get onto the website, you will then go to the part of their OSS community section. Once you are there,you will click on the Open Source Security Foundation underline word. It will take you to their website, once on their website, tap on the community section, click their github and it will take you to their github. One there goes to their contributing section of their read me and it will tell you what you need to know about contributing to their project.

5. The type of usable documentation that is in the project would be the read me that is in the github respiratory. In there you will find different types of documentation like their code of conduct, contributing, maintainer, contributing ladder, and much more. 

6. The way that the bugs and features request is by looking at the issues and pull requests that are listed at the top of their repository. In the issues tab of the open OSS project there are about 366 open issues. And I say most of the issues that are there are being worked on. Issues are being addressed because there are more closed issues than open issues.

7. I believe that if you were to download this content to your laptop, it shouldn't take too long for it to download.

8. Ways that the  developers talk to each other is through the slack channels that they have for the project. That's one way, another way is through the social media they have for the project.

9.The most intriguing discovery from looking at this open source project is seeing how the project is structured and the multiple sites that they have connected to the project. Another discovery is learning about the project and what it is about and what are the ins and outs of this project,
