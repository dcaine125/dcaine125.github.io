In the eight weeks that I have been participating in the Contributor Catalyst Program, I believe that this program didn’t help me directly reach my goal that I wanted to do. But in my opinion, it helped me grow as a worker and  helped me develop skills that needed much development. I feel like building certain skills from this program would help me further my progress to my goal. I appreciate all of the hard work the mentors of the program have given me in order to succeed. 

During our 4 weeks contributing to the Open SSF, we have made a big stride from being a first time contributor, to a somewhat regular in the open source world. While working with my group there were a number of issues/PR that I want to point out as ones that were interesting to me, as well as ones that made an impact on me as well. 

The first issue that I want to talk about is a pull request that we made PR#4714.This PR introduces an doc correction, specifically a change to the name of the header correcting the capitalization of the header and also making small changes to the punctuation in the file as well. I wanted to talk about this PR because it was our first one that got merged into a project and it was a big milestone for the Open SSF group.

 Another issue was #3616. This issue is another documentation change that asks contributors to rephrase the wording of a specific section in the CONTRIBUTING.md file. We made the changes and sent in a PR.  But we had to make multiple corrections and make changes so it would satisfy what the maintainer wanted. Once it looked all good it was merged.

While working as a Contributor Catalyst, the most interesting thing that I learned was that documentation is a big part of programming. I felt as I was taking a technical writing class last semester, I thought that this would have no impact on my career as a computer programmer, but as I did this internship it showed the importance of what I learned. After doing this internship I feel that I do have all of the tools  and experience I need to contribute to open source. I do not plan on staying engaged with open source because I am not all that interested in doing this for a career. But if the opportunity arises where I gain more interest in open source and I found a good job that I love, I wouldn’t hesitate to do it. I would help further opportunity in open source for people that are interested in it cause this program gave a lot to me and I would love to give back to the program.
