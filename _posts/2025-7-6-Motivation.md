In my lifetime, the one problem that I would solve with technology is trying to prevent ALS. I believe that ALS or Lou Gehrigâ€™s disease is a very heart breaking disease that can happen to a person. Watching a loved one slowly lose function of their ability to walk, use their arms, and even the ability to eat. If I could find a way to use technology to prevent it or help people function like normal with the disease, that would be my goal.

When I am successful, the first person I would tell is my Mom and siblings. Family is a very important thing for me and I would want them to be the first to know my most important accomplishment that I would achieve in my life.

A open source community that I would like to contribute to is [ALS Community](https://github.com/ShadowfallStudios/ALS-Community) I feel though there is not a lot of open source community that would help directly with the prevention/curing of ALS,  this a great community that I would like to contribute to.
