Hello, My name is Denzel Caine, I am from Wake Forest, North Carolina, I am a junior Computer Science Cybersecurity Major.

I have no experience in open source. Although I have no experience, I am very eagar and excited to lear about the exciting world of open source.

I believe that my strongest skill in working with a team is my ability to be a team player. I also an coachable and have the ability to be flexable with my team. another one of my skill is my pererverence. I am also creative when it comes to making new ideas for projects and etc.

One skill I would like to  improve is my ability to have better communication with my teamates. The way that I would improve on that skill is to get with diffrent people in the cohort and talk to them and inprove my communication thorgh that means.
